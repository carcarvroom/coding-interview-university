## Practice

### Make sure you have at least the following operations down pat:

- [ ] Initializing and using hash-backed maps (dictionaries) and sets
- [ ] Performing queue and stack operations (whether using an array, like with Ruby’s pop/shift, or an explicit standard library implementation like Java’s Stack and Linked List-backed Queue classes)
- [ ] Defining classes with constructors and attributes, static and instance methods, and defining a subclass and interface
- [ ] Throwing exceptions for (1) invalid input and (2) custom messages
- [ ] Iterating through arrays and dictionaries (both key and values)—including iterating while maintaining an index (Ruby’s eachwithindex, Python’s enumerate)
- [ ] Casting between strings and integers
- [ ] Strings: get character at index, get range, concatenate
- [ ] Initializing 2d arrays
- [ ] Arithmetic: modulus (remainder), division (if the first operand is an integer, will it round the result to an integer?), rounding (ceiling and floor)
(- [ ] Bonus) Switch statements
- [ ] (Bonus) Built-in language sorting. Quickly defining a comparator to sort an array.
- [ ] (More advanced candidates) The 5 standard bit manipulation operations (L/R shifts, not, or, and, xor)

### Have some opinions about it
- [ ] What do you like about language X?
- [ ] What don’t you like about it?
- [ ] How does it compare to (another language you profess to know)? Similarities/differences?
